# SHINOBIWAN LaunchPAD architecture

> Current application build: `2026.08.07.50` — release `audiolab-signal-first-20260807`.

LaunchPAD is a modular static PWA whose application source lives in GitHub `main`. The web shell is mirrored to GitHub Pages and Cloudflare Pages; production catalog/media state lives in Cloudflare R2 and is exposed through public/private Workers.

For the operational hosting map, see [`docs/DEPLOYMENT-TOPOLOGY.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT-TOPOLOGY.md).

## Source-of-truth boundaries

1. **Application/infrastructure code:** GitHub `main`.
2. **Track/media data:** R2 manifests, media objects and `catalog/index.json`.
3. **Deployment/service configuration:** versioned GitHub workflows/Wrangler config plus required external Cloudflare settings/secrets.

GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, generated `dist/` output and Lovable are not authoritative source trees.

## Boot and routing rules

1. `index.html` loads the static shell and `js/build-config.js`.
2. Build metadata versions dynamic stability/boot resources and the PWA cache namespace.
3. The recovery bootstrap initializes catalog/runtime state.
4. Remote catalog data is normalized through the shared schema/store before rendering.
5. `app-main.js` composes playback, views and feature modules.
6. Dedicated routes such as `#track=<id>` and `#studio=<id>` remain single-owner so Home cannot flash/render first.

Stable routes include:

```text
#home
#library
#favorites
#lyrics=<track-id>
#studio=<track-id>
#track=<track-id>
#album=<album-id>
#lab
#streaming
#about
```

## Player and page theme separation

The viewed track and currently playing track can differ. Theme scoping therefore maintains a page palette for the viewed detail context and a player palette for the loaded audio track. Theme writes are idempotent to avoid observer/render loops.

## Audio architecture

### Audible path

The user-facing music path is intentionally simple:

```text
HTMLAudioElement --> browser/native media pipeline --> output device
```

Audio Lab must not become part of this audible graph.

### Analysis path

Build 50 uses an independent analysis copy:

```text
track URL
   |
   +--> fetch + decodeAudioData
          |
          v
      AudioBufferSourceNode
          |
          v
       AnalyserNode --> FFT/time-domain readers --> visual renderers
          |
          v
      zero-gain sink
```

The decoded analysis source is synchronized to the main player's track, `currentTime` and playback rate. It is stopped when analysis is not needed and recreated after source changes.

### Audio Lab rendering contract

Spectrum is the reference visualizer because it reads the same FFT feed directly.

Build 50 makes the remaining reactive effects **signal-first**:

- **Neon Shatter** — fragment radius, size, angle offsets and cracks are driven primarily by per-bin FFT values/local spectral deltas and transient features. Time contributes only a tiny energy-gated drift.
- **Aurora Glass** — ribbon geometry is driven primarily by per-position spectral lift/delta plus bass/mid/high features. Autonomous loop-like phase motion was removed.
- **Liquid Chrome** — delegated to the live FFT pipeline with a modestly larger base radius and slightly stronger per-bin deformation.
- **Singularity** — delegated to the live FFT pipeline with a modestly wider event horizon/ring reach and slightly stronger per-bin arcs.
- **Nebula** — remains a base visual mode.

When playback is paused, signal-first effects receive zeroed input and settle rather than continuing a fake video-like loop.

## Canonical R2 structure

```text
catalog/index.json
tracks/<slug>/manifest.json
tracks/<slug>/audio.<ext>
tracks/<slug>/cover.<ext>
tracks/<slug>/thumbnail.webp
tracks/<slug>/lyrics.txt      # optional
tracks/<slug>/video.<ext>     # optional
```

`manifest.json` is the canonical per-track metadata record. `catalog/index.json` is the optimized public catalog snapshot generated from publishable manifests and derived flags.

## PWA / Canvas / Studio

The service worker caches same-origin application assets while audio/video media remain network-oriented. Mobile Lyrics actions may enter the track's Studio directly; the bottom navigation remains available in Studio. Track Canvas video is silent, looped and `playsinline`, with resume/recovery hooks for mobile lifecycle events.

## Deployment artifact

`scripts/build-cloudflare-pages.mjs` currently builds `dist/cloudflare-pages/` by copying the runtime verbatim. Despite the historical filename, the artifact is host-neutral and is also used by GitHub Pages.

`scripts/validate-cloudflare-pages-build.mjs` checks that the artifact matches the source runtime and includes required boot/feature files.

## Documentation/version contract

Every new application build must update every Markdown file to the exact `display` and `release` values from `js/build-config.js`. `scripts/validate-build-docs.mjs` enforces this during `npm run validate`.

## Architecture rules

1. `main` is the only application-code authority.
2. R2 manifests/media are the production track/media authority.
3. All UI consumers normalize tracks through the shared catalog schema/store.
4. The public Worker stays read-only and Range-capable.
5. The private Worker remains behind Cloudflare Access.
6. Audio/video delivery must not be silently trapped in the PWA static cache.
7. Hash routes remain shareable and have one owner each.
8. Feature code belongs in `js/features/`; shared state/helpers belong in `js/core/`.
9. Shell-changing releases advance `js/build-config.js` and the service-worker namespace through that metadata.
10. Web-host deployment, Worker deployment and R2 catalog rebuild are separate release states.
11. Deployment builders may copy/validate runtime files but may not patch production runtime code.
12. Lovable remains external prototyping unless a deliberate migration lands back in `main`.
13. Audio Lab visuals must prove reactivity against the live FFT feed rather than merely animate while playback is active.
14. Historical-looking compatibility files that remain wired into boot/deployment are removed only through dedicated regression-tested refactors.

## Validation

```bash
npm ci
npm run validate
npm run check:wrangler
```
