# SHINOBIWAN LaunchPAD

> Current application build: `2026.08.08.51` — release `audiolab-three-core-20260808`.

Installable music PWA for the SHINOBIWAN catalog: playback, albums, synchronized lyrics, Audio Lab visuals, favorites, queues, Track DNA, Canvas/Studio experiences and shareable track cards.

## Source of truth

**GitHub `main` is the only application-code authority.**

Public / staging hosts:

- GitHub Pages: `https://shinobione.github.io/LaunchPAD-APP/`
- Cloudflare Pages staging: `https://shinobiwan-launchpad-staging.pages.dev/`

Both hosts publish the same validated runtime from `main`. Cloudflare R2 remains the canonical media/catalog store; Workers remain separate backend deployment units. Lovable is prototype-only unless a future migration is explicitly promoted back through GitHub.

## Build 51 highlights

Build 51 resets Audio Lab to a deliberately small, testable core:

- **Neon Shatter**, **Spectrum** and **Liquid Chrome** are the only sanctioned presets.
- Spectrum remains the protected reference renderer and exposes the analyser feed used by the two custom effects.
- Neon Shatter was rebuilt around FFT-driven shard distance, size, rotation, cracks and impact rings.
- Liquid Chrome was rebuilt around an FFT-deformed metallic contour with bass pulse, mid-band fluidity and high-frequency specular detail.
- Aurora Glass, Nebula and Singularity are removed from the active registry/render paths instead of being kept as half-working presets.
- Custom effects use Spectrum's analyser first; the decoded analysis bridge is fallback-only.
- Time-based motion is gated by real signal activity so paused/silent playback settles instead of looking like a looping animation.
- Build 51 advances the PWA cache namespace so clients cannot keep serving the Build 50 Audio Lab bundle as the current runtime.

Recent releases also restored mobile Lyrics → Studio routing, persistent mobile navigation in Studio, resilient Canvas looping, CORS-safe Visual Card export and single-owner track routing.

## Canonical media model

Production media lives in R2:

```text
catalog/index.json
tracks/<slug>/manifest.json
tracks/<slug>/audio.<ext>
tracks/<slug>/cover.<ext>
tracks/<slug>/thumbnail.webp
tracks/<slug>/lyrics.txt      # optional
tracks/<slug>/video.<ext>     # optional
```

The public application hydrates through the public Worker. Localhost/CI may use deterministic fixtures; production must not silently substitute a bundled production catalog.

## Local development

```bash
npm ci
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/`.

A local HTTP server is required for ES modules, media behavior and the service worker.

## Validation

Before merging application or infrastructure changes:

```bash
npm run validate
npm run check:wrangler
```

CI checks browser navigation, PWA/service-worker behavior, Audio Lab signal contracts, catalog contracts, Cloudflare bundles, repository cleanliness, documentation/build coherence and desktop overflow regressions.

## Release discipline

A runtime build advances in one place: `js/build-config.js`.

Every build that changes that metadata must update **all Markdown documentation** to the same `display` and `release` values. `npm run check:build-docs` enforces this so README/architecture/roadmap/deployment docs cannot silently lag behind the shipped build.

Web-host deployment, Worker deployment and R2 catalog publication remain separate states. Do not report “deployed” without saying which state changed.

## Repository rules

1. `main` is the only source of truth.
2. Do not edit production code only in Cloudflare, GitHub Pages, Lovable or generated `dist/` output.
3. Temporary feature/fix branches are disposable and automatically deleted after merge.
4. Advance application versions only in `js/build-config.js`.
5. Update every `.md` file for every new build; CI validates the build/release markers.
6. Keep Worker deployment, web deployment and R2 catalog rebuild as separate explicit states.
7. Spectrum remains the Audio Lab reference path; visual effects must consume the real FFT feed rather than independent loop animation.
8. Historical-looking compatibility files still wired into boot/deployment are removed only through dedicated refactors, not cosmetic cleanup.
