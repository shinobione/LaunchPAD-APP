# SHINOBIWAN LaunchPAD

> Current application build: `2026.08.08.59` — release `direct-impact-20260808`.

Installable music PWA for the SHINOBIWAN catalog: playback, albums, synchronized lyrics, Audio Lab visuals, favorites, queues, Track DNA, Canvas/Studio experiences and shareable track cards.

## Source of truth

**GitHub `main` is the only application-code authority.**

Public / staging hosts:

- GitHub Pages: `https://shinobione.github.io/LaunchPAD-APP/`
- Cloudflare Pages staging: `https://shinobiwan-launchpad-staging.pages.dev/`

Both hosts publish the same validated runtime from `main`. Cloudflare R2 remains the canonical media/catalog store; Workers remain separate backend deployment units. Lovable is prototype-only unless a future migration is explicitly promoted back through GitHub.

## Build 59 highlights

Build 59 fixes the remaining transient-impact failure exposed by real-device testing: Build 58 detected low-frequency onsets correctly but fed them back into already-clamped renderer targets, so dense passages could still look flat.

- **Spectrum**, **Neon Shatter** and **Liquid Chrome** remain untouched as the trusted baseline.
- Build 57's integrated phase still owns continuous travel, rotation, breathing and groove motion.
- Build 58's adaptive low-frequency tracker still compares fast bass, slow local baseline, low-bin positive flux and short-term bass rise.
- A new `createDirectVisualImpactTracker()` converts rising punch/kick/low-band contrast into a short visual-only impulse with its own decay.
- The impulse is applied **after** the normal renderer pose through `applyDirectKineticImpact()`, preserving visual headroom even when bass/kick spring targets are already near their clamp ceiling.
- Pulse Reactor gets a whole-reactor expansion/twist hit; Bass Fracture gets a horizontal rupture/compression hit; Gravity Lens gets an anisotropic snap/rotation; Bio Structure gets an organic contraction/expansion hit.
- Audio Lab telemetry now exposes both `audioLabPunch` and `audioLabVisualImpact`, making detector activity and actual visual impulse separately observable.
- No new primitives, private RAF/timer, random motion or higher mobile DPR budget is introduced; the extra movement is a cheap canvas transform.
- The PWA cache advances to v59 so Build 58 renderer/controller code cannot remain hidden in an installed PWA cache.

## Canonical media model

Production media lives in R2:

```text
catalog/index.json
tracks/<slug>/manifest.json
tracks/<slug>/audio.<ext>
tracks/<slug>/cover.<ext>
tracks/<slug>/thumbnail.webp
tracks/<slug>/lyrics.txt      # optional
tracks/<slug>/video.<ext>     # optional
```

The public application hydrates through the public Worker. Localhost/CI may use deterministic fixtures; production must not silently substitute a bundled production catalog.

## Local development

```bash
npm ci
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/`.

A local HTTP server is required for ES modules, media behavior and the service worker.

## Validation

Before merging application or infrastructure changes:

```bash
npm run validate
npm run check:wrangler
```

CI checks browser navigation, PWA/service-worker behavior, Audio Lab signal contracts, catalog contracts, Cloudflare bundles, repository cleanliness, documentation/build coherence and desktop overflow regressions.

## Release discipline

A runtime build advances in one place: `js/build-config.js`.

Every build that changes that metadata must update **all Markdown documentation** to the same `display` and `release` values. `npm run check:build-docs` enforces this so README/architecture/roadmap/deployment docs cannot silently lag behind the shipped build.

Web-host deployment, Worker deployment and R2 catalog publication remain separate states. Do not report “deployed” without saying which state changed.

## Repository rules

1. `main` is the only source of truth.
2. Do not edit production code only in Cloudflare, GitHub Pages, Lovable or generated `dist/` output.
3. Temporary feature/fix branches are disposable and automatically deleted after merge.
4. Advance application versions only in `js/build-config.js`.
5. Update every `.md` file for every new build; CI validates the build/release markers.
6. Keep Worker deployment, web deployment and R2 catalog rebuild as separate explicit states.
7. Spectrum remains the Audio Lab reference path; every visual effect must consume the real FFT feed rather than independent loop animation.
8. Add Audio Lab presets one at a time, with desktop and mobile budgets defined before merge.
9. Prefer deterministic, signal-derived geometry over random particles when a visual must remain cheap on mobile.
10. Continuous movement and transient impact must stay separate: groove energy owns travel; detected onset creates a post-pose impact with reserved visual headroom.
11. Motion memory/kinetic phase must stop when the real audio target disappears and must never become an autonomous screensaver.
12. Historical-looking compatibility files still wired into boot/deployment are removed only through dedicated refactors, not cosmetic cleanup.
